# keyboard-butler
This bit of code allows you to set up keyboard shortcuts and use quick and easy for tasks such as printing out your passwords instantly if you are needing to go in and out of accounts really fast or if you would simply just like to hit (shift+r) and have it print out a whole message where your cursor stands.
